Project Changed

The project has been switched from a website creation project to a machine learning snow height estimation project

The project is for the IceCube Observatory in the south pole

The plan is to use the snow height measurements, which have been recorded semi annual in 162 locations since 2000, in conjunction with weather data (wind, pressure, temperature),
in order to predict the next snow height measurement. 

The goal will be to create the most accurate predictor.

Extension goals include: 
- making is so the predictor can predict the snow height inbetween measurements
- allowing the predictor to predict more than one time step into the future (possibly very difficult)
- making it so the predictor can predict the height based on the time input
