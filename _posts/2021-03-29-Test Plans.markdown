## Deliverable:

Along with the research, I am also planning on including a python program that demonstrates the methods outlined in the research. The purpose of this demonstration program is primarily to package all written code into an organized script such that those interested will have the resources to look deeper into the workings of the project. 


1. ### Specific Objective  
- The research product should be easy to follow, not buried in complexities
- A person with minimal knowledge in computer science should have no issue following along with the report
- The demonstration program instructions should be easy to understand
- The demonstration program should be executable on any windows pc
2. ### Specific Tests
- The research presentation will be approved by the project lead/ mentor Dr. Rawlins prior to the date of the actual presentation.
- The research product and methods will also be approved by the project lead/ mentor Dr. Rawlins
- The demonstration program will be tested and validated by Dr. Rawlins
- The demonstration program will also be tested on 3 separate windows computers
3. ### Class Testing
- Students of the Capstone class will also be asked to test the program once it is available
5. ### Edge cases
- Testers will be asked to test a combination of arguments while using the demonstration program
- The following are the variations in arguments available:
- Dataset - time series, delta time series, weather based
- Station - 1a to 15b
- Timeframe - datetime between 2014 to now
- verbosityLevel - 0, 1, 2, 3
6. ### Stress Test
- a test program will be written to make sure all of the internal methods work
7. ### Feedback
- Any specific feedback by Dr. Rawlins about the utility of the project will be included in the report
