Every year, researchers atop the IceCube Observatory in the South Pole take samples of the snow heights in order to fuel their climate-based research projects. The only problem is that the data is sparse as researchers cannot afford to take measurements more than a couple times per year and especially not during the 6 months of the year when it is dark. If only there was a way of accurately predicting the snow height for any given time during the year. With recent advances in data science, new machine learning methods may hold the key to solving this problem. 

Over the course of this project, I test various regression based machine learning models over various height and weather data in an attempt to create a usable snow height predictor model.
